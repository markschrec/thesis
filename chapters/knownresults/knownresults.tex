\chapter{Known Results on Finite Generation}
\label{ch:known}

Throughout this chapter $(G,(U_\alpha)_{\alpha\in \Phi},T)$ will be an RGD system of type $(W,S)$ with the following assumptions:
\smallskip
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	&W \text{ has rank 3, }S=\{s,t,u\},\: a=m(s,t),b=m(s,u),c=m(t,u)\\
	&3\le a\le b\le c\\
	&[U_\alpha,U_\beta]=1\text{ when }\alpha,\beta \text{ are nested}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\smallskip

Let $\Sigma$ be the Coxeter complex of $W$ with fundamental chamber $C,$ and $\Phi_+$ be the positive roots of $\Sigma.$ We will also let $U_+=\langle U_\alpha|\alpha\in \Phi_+\rangle$ be the subgroup of $G$ generated by the positive root groups. We will also note that properties of RGD systems tell us that $a,b,c\in \{2,3,4,6,8\}$ and thus by \eqref{assume} we know that $a,b,c\in \{3,4,6,8\}.$

%Throughout this section, $\G$ will be a Kac-Moody group with rank 3 Weyl group $W$ over a field $k.$ We will also assume that $W$ is defined by the Coxeter diagram with edge labels $a,b,c\in\{3,4,6\}$ with $a\le b\le c$ and $c\ge 4.$ This last condition ensures that $W$ is hyperbolic. Let $\Sigma$ be the Coxeter complex of $W.$ Let $\Phi^+$ be the positive roots of $\Sigma,$ and for any $\alpha\in \Phi^+$ we will let $U_\alpha$ be the root group associated to $\alpha.$

For any vertex $v$ of $\Sigma,$ there will be some walls of $\Sigma$ which pass through $v,$ and for each of these walls we have a unique \emph{positive} root. We will call these the \textbf{positive roots at $v$} and denote them by $\Phi_+^v.$ Recall that $\st(v)$ is defined as all the chambers containing $v$ as a vertex. If there are $n$ positive roots at $v$ then $|\st(v)|=2n.$ Furthermore, it is possible to label the positive roots at $v$ as $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$ in such a way that $\alpha_i\cap \alpha_j\subset \alpha_k$ for any $1\le i\le k\le j\le n.$ This ordering is unique up to a reversal of the form $\alpha_i\mapsto \alpha_{n+1-i}.$ This possible reversal will not matter in most cases and if it does then a choice of $\alpha_1$ will be specified. It does however allow us to unambigiously define $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_n$ as the \textbf{simple} roots at $v.$ They are the unique positive roots at $v$ whose intersection is contained in all other positive roots at $v.$

Now we can define $U_v$ to be the subgroup of $G$ generated by all of the root groups of the positive roots at $v.$ That is
\[
U_v=\langle U_\alpha|\alpha \text{ is a positive root at }v\rangle=\langle U_\alpha|\alpha\in \Phi_+^v\rangle
\]
If $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_n$ is a standard ordering of the positive roots at $v$ then we can simplify notation by letting $U_i=U_{\alpha_i}$ for all $\alpha_i$ through $v.$ Since $v$ is a simples of $\Sigma$ of co-dimension 2, we know from the theory of RGD systems that $U_v$ will also have the structure of a spherical, rank 2 RGD system as well. Let $U'_v=\langle U_1,U_n\rangle$ be the subgroup of $U_v$ generated by the simple root groups, where $|\st(v)|=2n.$ Then it is known that $U_v=U'_v=\langle U_1,U_n\rangle$ with the exception of a few cases which we will explictly state in the following Lemma.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:index}
	Let $v$ be a vertex of $\Sigma$ with $|\st(v)|=2n$ and let $U'_v=\langle U_1,U_n\rangle$ where $U_1,U_n$ are the root groups of the simple roots at $v.$ Then the group $U_v$ is has the structure of a spherical, rank 2 RGD system and $U_v=U'_v$ unless $U_v$ is isomorphic to one of the following groups:
	\[
		C_2(2)\qquad G_2(2) \qquad G_2(3) \qquad {}^2F_4(2)
	\]
	In fact, we also know the index $[U_v:U'_v]$ in each of these cases which is summarized in the following table.
	\[
		\begin{array}{c|c}
			U_v&[U_v:U'_v]\\\hline
			C_2(2)&2\\
			G_2(2)&4\\
			G_2(3)&3\\
			{}^2F_4(2)&2
		\end{array}
	\]
\end{lemma}

We can see from the previous lemma that even when $U'_v\neq U_v,$ it is still a fairly large subgroup and in some cases it will even be normal. This will allow us to construct helpful homomorphisms later, but before we do so we will explicitly state the desired result.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:normal}
	Suppose $v$ is a vertex of $\Sigma$ with $|\st(v)|=2n$ such that $[U_v:U'_v]\ge 2.$ If $U_v$ is isomorphic to $C_2(2), G_2(3),$ or ${}^2F_4(2)$ then $U'_v$ is a normal subgroup of $U_v.$ If $U_v\cong G_2(2)$ then $U'_v$ is not a normal subgroup of $U_v,$ but there is a standard labeling of the positive roots through $v$ so that $U''_v=\langle U_{1},U_{5},U_{6}\rangle$ is a normal subgroup of $U_v$ with $[U_v:U''_v]=2.$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	If $U_v\cong C_2(2)$ or ${}^2F_4(2)$ then $U'_v$ is a subgroup of index 2 and thus it is normal. If $U_v\cong G_2(3)$ then $U_v$ is a 3-group and thus $3$ is the smallest prime dividing $|U_v|$ and we know that $U'_v$ is normal in this case as well.

	Now suppose $U_v\cong G_2(2).$ \textcolor{red}{\Huge Need to add this proof later\normalsize}
\end{proof}

Using Lemma \ref{lem:normal} and elementary group theory, we get the following result.
\begin{cor}
	\label{cor:phiv}
	Suppose $v$ is a vertex of $\Sigma$ with $|\st(v)|=2n$ such that $[U_v:U'_v]\ge 2.$ Then there is a cyclic group $H$ and a surjective group homomorphism $\phi_v:U_v\to H$ with the property that $\phi_v(U_1)=\phi_v(U_n)=\{1\}$ where $U_1$ and $U_n$ are the simple root groups at $v.$
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	If $[U_v:U'_v]\ge 2$ then $U_v$ must be isomorphic to one of $C_2(2),G_2(2),G_2(3),{}^2F_4(2).$ If $U_v\cong C_2(2),G_2(3),{}^2F_4(2)$ then we can apply Lemma \ref{lem:normal} to let $H=U_v/U'_v$ and $\phi_v$ be the quotient map which certainly will be surjective and send $U_1$ and $U_n$ to $\{1\}$ by the definition of $U'_v.$ The group $H$ is cyclic because it has prime order.

	If $U_v\cong G_2(2)$ then we know that $U'_v\subset U''_v=\langle U_1,U_5,U_6\rangle$ for an appropreate standard labeling, and we again apply Lemma \ref{lem:normal} to set $H=U_v/U''_v$ and $\phi_v$ as the quotient map. The group $H$ is again cyclic because it has prime order.
\end{proof}

The following corollary will show that we do not have very much wiggle room when defining $\phi_v,$ and thus if we can write any function which ``looks like'' $\phi_v$ then they must be esentially the same.
\begin{cor}
	\label{cor:uniquephiv}
	Suppose $v$ is a vertex of $\Sigma$ with $|\st(v)|=2n$ such that $[U_v:U'_v]\ge 2$ and let $\phi_v$ be defined as in the previous corollary. Then $\ker \phi_v$ is the unique, proper, normal subgroup of $U_v$ which contains $U_1$ and $U_n.$
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	If $U_v\cong C_2(2),G_2(3),{}^2F_4(2)$ then $U'_v$ is normal, it is generated by $U_1$ and $U_n,$, and it has prime index so there cannot be another proper subgroup containing $U'_v.$ By the construction of $\phi_v,$ we also know that $\ker \phi_v=U'_v$ so that $\ker\phi_v$ is the unique proper, normal subgroup of $U_v$ containing $U_1$ and $U_n.$

	If $U_v\cong G_2(2)$ then $\ker \phi_v=U''_v=\langle U_1,U_5,U_6\rangle$ under a standard labeling. If $N$ is any normal subgroup containing $U_1$ and $U_n$ then we can apply the commutator relations in $G_2(2)$ to get \textcolor{red}{\Huge add proof later\normalsize}
\end{proof}

So far we have only considered each vertex $v$ and $U_v$ separately. But in the Coxeter complex $\Sigma,$ we have not only a collection of vertices, but an action of the group $W$ on the vertices which behaves nicely with properties like the type of a vertex. We will show that the $W$ action also interacts nicely with $U_v$ and $\phi_v$ in a similar way.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem:resporder}
	Suppose $v$ is a vertex of $\Sigma$ of type $s,$ $|\st(v)|=2n,$ and $[U_v:U'_v]\ge 2.$ Also suppose that $w$ is an element of $W$ such that $w\gamma$ is a positive root at $wv$ for every positive root $\gamma$ at $v.$ Then there are standard labelings $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$ and $\alpha'_1,\dots,\alpha'_n$ of the positive roots through $v$ and $wv$ respectively such that $\alpha'_i=w\alpha_i$ for all $i.$ In particular, $w$ sends roots at $v$ which are simple to roots at $v'$ which are also simple. Furthermore, if $v'$ is any vertex of $\Sigma$ of type $s$ then there is a $w\in W$ such that $wv=v'$ and $w\gamma$ is a positive root at $v'$ for any positive $\gamma$ at $v.$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Recall a standard labeling is on of the form $\alpha_1,\dots, \alpha_n$ where $\alpha_i\cap \alpha_j\subset \alpha_k$ for all $1\le i\le k\le j\le n.$ If $w$ sends all of the positive roots at $v$ to the positive roots at $wv$ then $w$ induces a bijection on the positive roots at $v$ and $wv.$ Now we can define a labeling of the positive roots at $wv$ by $\alpha'_i=w\alpha_i$ for all $i.$ It only remains to check that this is a standard labeling. If $1\le i\le k\le j\le n$ then $\alpha_i\cap \alpha_j\subset \alpha_k$ and thus $\alpha'_i\cap \alpha'_j=w\alpha_i\cap w\alpha_j\subset w\alpha_k=\alpha_k'$ so this is a standard labeling as desired.

Now it suffices to show that such a $w$ exists for any vertex $v'$ in $\Sigma.$ Since the $W$ action on $\Sigma$ is transitive on vertices of the same type, it will suffice to show the result when $v$ is a vertex of the fundamental chamber $C.$ Let $D=\proj_{v'}(C)$ so that $d(D,C)$ is minimal among all chambers of $\st(v').$ Then we know that no walls through $v'$ can separate $D$ and $C,$ because crossing one of these walls would produce a chamber in $\st(v)$ which is closer to $C.$ Therefore, a root at $v'$ is positive if and only if it contains $D.$

Now choose the unique $w\in W$ such that $D=wC.$ We claim that $w$ satisfies the desired properties. First of all, $v$ is a vertex of $C$ of type $s$ and thus $wv$ is a vertex of $wC=D$ of type $s.$ But we know that $v'$ is a vertex of $D$ of type $s$ by definition and thus $wv=v'$ as desired. Now suppose $\gamma$ is any positive root at $v.$ Then $C\in \gamma$ and thus $D=wC\in w\gamma$ and thus $C\in w\gamma$ so $w\gamma$ is positive at $wv=v'.$ Now this $w$ sends positive roots at $v$ to positive roots at $v'$ as desired.

\end{proof}

Before moving on it is worth clarifying that the type $s$ of the vertex $v$ in the previous lemma can by any type, not just the literal type $s$ in the definition of $W.$

The previous result can also be used to show that the $W$ action on $\Sigma$ also behaves nicely with respect to the group $U_v$ and the homomorphisms $\phi_v$ when they exit.
\begin{cor}
	\label{cor:respectphiv}
	Suppose $v$ is a vertex of $\Sigma$ with $|\st(v)|=2n$ and $[U_v:U'_v]\ge 2$ and $v'$ is any other vertex of $\Sigma$ of the same type. Then there is an isomorphism between $U_v$ and $U_{v'}$ which sends $U'_v$ to $U'_{v'}.$ Consequently, $[U_v:U'_v]=[U_{v'}:U'_{v'}],$ $\phi_v$ exists if and only if $\phi_{v'}$ exists, and if $\phi_v$ exists then this isomorphism sends $\ker \phi_v$ to $\ker \phi_{v'}.$ If $w$ is any element of $W$ such that $wv=v'$ and $w\gamma$ is positive for all positive $\gamma$ at $v,$ then this isomorphism can be defined by the property that $U_\gamma$ is sent to $U_{w\gamma}$ for every $\gamma$ at $v.$
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	Let $w$ be any element of $W$ with $wv=v'$ which sends positive roots at $v$ to positive roots at $v'.$ Such a $w$ is guaranteed to exist by Lemma \ref{lem:resporder}. By the theory of RGD systems there is an element $\tilde{w}\in G$ such that $\tilde{w}U_\alpha (\tilde{w})^{-1}=U_{w\alpha}$ for all $\alpha\in \Phi.$ Let $f_w:G\to G$ be the isomorphism of conjugation by $\tilde{w}.$ Since $w\gamma$ is positive at $v'$ for every positive root $\gamma$ at $v$ we know that $f_w(U_\gamma)=U_{w\gamma}\subset U_{v'}$ and thus $f_w$ restricts to a homomorphism $\bar{f}_w:U_v\to U_{v'}$ which is necessesarily injective. But $w$ also give a bijection on positive roots at $v$ and $v',$ and $U_{v'}$ is generated by positive root groups at $v'$ so $\bar{f}_w$ is surjective and thus an isomorphism. Now it remains to check it statisfies the rest of the properties. 

	Since $w$ preserves standard labelings at $v$ and $v'$ we know that it also preserves simple roots. Thus $\bar{f}_w(U_{\alpha_1})=U_{\alpha'_1}$ for a standard labeling, and similarly for $U_{\alpha_n}$ and $U_{\alpha'_n}.$ Since $U'_v=\langle U_{\alpha_1},U_{\alpha_n}\rangle$ and $U'_{v'}=\langle U_{\alpha'_1},U_{\alpha'_n}\rangle$ we can also see that $\bar{f}_w$ sends $U'_v$ to $U'_{v'}.$ Since $\bar{f}_w$ is an isomorphism it also preserves index so $[U_v:U'_v]=[U_{v'}:U'_{v'}].$

	For any vertex $v,$ the map $\phi_v$ exists if and only if $[U_v:U'_v]\ge 2$ and thus $\phi_v$ will exist exactly when $\phi_{v'}$ exists. By Corollary \ref{cor:uniquephiv} we know that $\ker \phi_v$ is a proper normal subgroup of $U_v$ contaning $U'_v$ and thus $\bar{f}_w(\ker \phi_v)$ will be a proper, normal subgroup of $U_{v'}$ containing $U'_{v'}.$ By Corollary \ref{cor:uniquephiv} again this means $\bar{f}_w(\ker \phi_v)=\ker \phi_{v'}$ which completes the result.

\end{proof}



\vspace{1 in}
The general theory gives us the following result
\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:knownfg}
	Let $(G,(U_\alpha)_{\alpha\in \Phi},T)$ be an RGD system of type $(W,S)$ of any rank. If $U_v=U'_v$ for every vertex $v$ of $\Sigma$ then $U_+$ is finitely generated.
\end{theorem}

Remark: In fact, we can make an even stronger statement. Let $\alpha_s$ be the positive root defined by the wall which separates $C$ and $sC$ and similarly define  $\alpha_t$ and $\alpha_u.$ If $U'_v=U_v$ for all $v\in \Sigma$ then $U$ is generated by $ U_{\alpha_s}, U_{\alpha_t},$ and  $U_{\alpha_u}.$
